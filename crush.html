    <p class="text"> <span class="special">So, it all began with a simple crush…</span><br/>
A quiet little feeling that slowly grew into something so deep, so unshakable  a journey that brought us this far, walking hand-in-hand on a road called forever.

I know this road ends only with time itsel fmaybe even with death and I don’t know if these words can ever fully express what I feel. But even now, just hearing your name makes my heart overflow with love.

I may not always express it, I may fall silent sometimes…
But please know  I’m so grateful to have you.
So happy to call you mine.
And so ready to walk this journey with you through every high and every low.

Even when times are tough, even if we feel weak, I’ll be right there beside you.
Whether it’s your dreams, your struggles, your career, or your chaos  I’ll be holding your hand through it all.

Because my love for you isn’t just a moment.
It’s a promise  to love you till the very end of our journey.
I love you so much. ❤️</p>
